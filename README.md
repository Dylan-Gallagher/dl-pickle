# DL-Pickle 
## A Deep Learning Library written in Python
It's pronounced "dill pickle", my nickname growing up, nothing to do with Python Pickle. (I thought it was funny, ok)

## What is it?
It's a deep learning library written in Python. It uses PyTorch Tensors under the hood, but I'm working on making my own tensor library in C++.

## Why?
I made this project primarily to learn how deep learning libraries work under the hood.

## Installation
You can just clone the repo using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dylan-Gallagher/dl-pickle.git
```

## Usage
Look at `src/test.py` for example usage.

## Project Status
This project is functional, but still in development. To see the latest (untested) features, look at the `testing` branch.
My next steps are to make a more complex neural network architecture, such as a ResNet or Stable Diffusion Network.
I am also looking into speeding up the library by writing a C++ tensor library.
